# VectorSearch-with-HNSW
VectorSearch with HNSW is a comprehensive implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces. This project demonstrates practical applications of approximate nearest neighbor search using the Fashion MNIST dataset as a case study.
